composting
==========

I am composting at home using a "bokashi" method. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokashi_composting#Bokashi
In order to be self sufficient using a fermentation/bacterial composting method i had to culture my own lacto bacillius which is pretty easy and ive made my own bokashi bucket out of leftover materials at home.
